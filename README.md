<h3><strong>Guardians for the Missing</strong></h3>

This is a client I have worked with over the years and have seen many versions of the website, this being the first fully custom code build. I believe the one prior to this was built using GoDaddy page builder. I eventually developed this website using HTML and CSSS. I interegated her Facebook page newsfeed and messaging feature so she could focus on her Facebook posts. Since then, we have converted her website to WordPress found here: https://guardiansforthemissing.com/
